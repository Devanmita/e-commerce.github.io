                <h2>What is E Commerce</h2>
                <p>E-commerce (electronic commerce) is the buying and selling of goods and services, or the transmitting of funds or data, over an electronic network, primarily the internet. These business transactions occur either as business-to-business (B2B), business-to-consumer (B2C), consumer-to-consumer or consumer-to-business.

                    The terms e-commerce and e-business are often used interchangeably. The term e-tail is also sometimes used in reference to the transactional processes that make up online retail shopping.
                    
                    In the last two decades, widespread use of e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and eBay has contributed to substantial growth in online retail. In 2011, e-commerce accounted for 5% of total retail sales, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. By 2020, with the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, it had risen to over 16% of retail sales.</p>

                <h2>How does e-commerce work?</h2>
                <p>E-commerce is powered by the internet. Customers access an online store to browse through and place orders for products or services via their own devices.As the order is placed, the customer's web browser will communicate back and forth with the server hosting the e-commerce website. Data pertaining to the order will be relayed to a central computer known as the order manager. It will then be forwarded to databases that manage inventory levels; a merchant system that manages payment information, using applications such as PayPal; and a bank computer. Finally, it will circle back to the order manager. This is to make sure that store inventory and customer funds are sufficient for the order to be processed.</p>

                <h2>Advantages of e-commerce</h2>
                <p>Benefits of e-commerce include its around-the-clock availability, the speed of access, the wide availability of goods and services, easy accessibility and international reach.</p>
                <li>Availability: Aside from outages and scheduled maintenance, e-commerce sites are available 24/7, enabling visitors to browse and shop at any time. Brick-and-mortar businesses tend to open for a fixed number of hours and may even close entirely on certain days.</li>
                <li>Speed of access: While shoppers in a physical store can be slowed by crowds, e-commerce sites run quickly, which is determined by compute and bandwidth considerations on both the consumer device and the e-commerce site. Product and shopping cart pages load in a few seconds or less. An e-commerce transaction can comprise a few clicks and take less than five minutes.</li>
                <li>Wide availability: Amazon's first slogan was "Earth's Biggest Bookstore." It could make this claim because it was an e-commerce site and not a physical store that had to stock each book on its shelves. E-commerce enables brands to make a wide array of products available, which are then shipped from a warehouse or various warehouses after a purchase is made. Customers will likely have more success finding what they want.</li>
                <li>Easy accessibility: Customers shopping a physical store may have difficulty locating a particular product. Website visitors can browse product category pages in real time and use the site's search feature to find the product immediately.</li>
